# Hand-Written-Text-Recognition
This project includes an implementation of pytorch library, named Mytorch, and the library is used to construct a fully connected neural network for hand-written text recognition. 
## Introduction
Mytorch is a partial implementation of Pytorch library. It includes a framework of automatic differentiation (autograd). During forward propagation, autograd will automatically construct a computational graph. During back propagation, the gradients for operations that require gradient will be calculated through recursion. Other functionalities of Mytorch includes: ReLU activation, cross entropy loss function, and SGD optimizer.
